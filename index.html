            I hail from a family with roots in Bangladesh: my parents, Mark and
            Keya, are first-generation Bengali immigrants. My younger sister,
            Sonya, recently began her journey as a freshman at Milton Academy. I
            spent the initial seven years of my life in Dix Hills, New York,
            before relocating to Frisco, Texas. During my time in Texas, I
            transitioned between four different schools and moved houses, making
            the adjustments considerably challenging. After spending another
            seven years in Texas, I felt drawn to the academic opportunities in
            New England and decided to apply to boarding schools there. I've now
            spent three enriching years at Milton, where I've experienced growth
            not only academically but also on a personal level.

            Since elementary school, I have always loved the opportunity of
            being a part of my school community beyond taking classes during the
            required hours. I desired to have engage in the afterschool
            opportunities my school offered such as Green Team and Math and
            Science Team. Although I do not pursue the same afterschool
            activities, I do love to participate in clubs, publications, and
            affinities at Milton. From being a co-head of Muslim Students
            Association to being a founder of Microfinance Club, I strive to
            learn more about my passions through these organizations.

            Although Milton Academy provides lots of opportunities to serve the
            school community and greater Boston community. I also work with
            national and international level organizations to pursue my
            passions. For example, my nonprofit Walivest which is dedicated
            towards stepping in before disasters strike, making sure communities
            are ready for whatever comes their way. Also being an events
            coordinator for the Youth Economics Initiative where I help organize
            events such as economics quiz bowls and financial literacy contests.
